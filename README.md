## 🚀 Featured Project

### 🤖 AI Agent for TurtleBot Navigation with Gemini  
I built an **AI agent** that controls a **TurtleBot** using **Gemini**:  
- Gemini interprets high-level natural language instructions (e.g., "patrol this area" or "go near the table").  
- The agent converts these instructions into **ROS 2 navigation goals**.  
- The TurtleBot performs SLAM for mapping and localization.  
- The robot autonomously navigates and executes tasks in its environment.  

**Tech Stack:** ROS 2 · Python · Gemini LLM · SLAM · Navigation2

## 📚 Learning Journey

- Building a **solid foundation** in robotics math: kinematics, transformations, optimization  
- Exploring **AI-driven control**: RL for locomotion & manipulation  
- Mastering **simulation tools** before deploying to real hardware

## 🎯 Long-Term Vision

> **“Robotics is the ultimate integration of AI and engineering.”**  

I aim to **develop humanoids** and advance **Physical AI** — designing embodied agents that:  
- **See** the world through vision and multimodal perception  
- **Think** using LLMs, reasoning, and planning algorithms  
- **Act** autonomously to assist, collaborate, and interact with humans in real-world environments  

My ultimate goal is to push the boundaries of **robot intelligence**, making humanoids and embodied AI more capable, safe, and useful.
